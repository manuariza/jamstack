"An inarguably well-designed Jekyll theme by Pat Dryburgh. Undoubtably one of the great minds of our time, [Christopher Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) challenged his readers to think deeply on topics of politics, religion, war, and science. This Jekyll theme's design is inspired by the trade paperback version his book, [Arguably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arguably), and is dedicated to his memory."
