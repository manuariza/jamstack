# A rich starter kit for Ghost blogs

Create and publish flaring fast blogs with this Jamify blogging system. Powered by the React framework Next.js and content fed by headleass Ghost, you'll get a production ready hybrid static & server rendered website that you can easily distribute globally. At the same time your content creators can continue to work with the Ghost authoring system as they used to. Fully open-source and easy to customize.
