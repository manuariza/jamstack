description: This is a port of the Dark Portfolio Template by W3C to 11ty!
stale: true

The original, pure CSS template was created by W3C, [you can check it out here!](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_dark_portfolio.htm)

This has been "ported" to run on Eleventy, and stays true to the original as much as possible.
Uses the original W3.css with no modifications!

## Eleventy specific additions
- The last 6 posts with the "photo" tag will be used in the front page portfolio section.
- The starter blog boilerplate has been left in.
- The Archive link was left in
- A "files" folder has been added with a fake resume for use with the "download resume" button
- Inside _data/faNav.json is a list of the Navigation keys and their corresponding FontAwesome icon class
