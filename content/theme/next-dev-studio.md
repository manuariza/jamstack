# A small business website using Next.js and Markdown

Two years ago I built my studio [website](https://github.com/lwz7512/one-click-hugo-cms) using [one click hugo cms](https://github.com/netlify-templates/one-click-hugo-cms), now my tech stack switched to Nextjs, so I migrated that into a Nextjs version(in three days).

## Features

* No code website
* Define website in Markdown content
* Easy style customization
* Minimum CSS inclusion with purgecss
