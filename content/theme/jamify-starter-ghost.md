# A rich starter kit for Ghost blogs

This starter template is for professional publishers who are looking for a fully functional static-site front-end with infinite-scroll, flexible routing, multi-language support and a rich plugin eco-system. It's built with performance in mind (auto image resizing, lazy loading with gatsby-image, and more) and comes with support for newsletter sign-up, easy comments integration and more. This starter features support for incremental builds thereby delivering the fastest build times ever seen.
